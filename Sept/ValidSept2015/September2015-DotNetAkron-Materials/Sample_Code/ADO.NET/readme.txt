In order to use either of these samples you must modify the connection string to point to your database. In both of the projects there is an app.config file containing the connection string. Modify this string to point to your server instead of the PROFESSORX server. If you are not sure of your server's name open SSMS and the server will be listed at the login screen. 

Also note if you cannot login using the Trusted Connection you will have to modify this connection string to use username and password instead.
